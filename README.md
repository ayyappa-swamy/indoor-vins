VINS for an Indoor Quadrotor System

#### Details
Navigating a quadrotor system indoors is challenging as it cannot rely on GPS. Due to limited space and size, its payload capability is reduced. Furthermore, fast and complex dynamics of the system demands accurate state estimation with less computation time. So, in this project, state-of-the-art methods in using visual-inertial navigation system (VINS) for indoor state estimation of a quadrotor will be studied.
